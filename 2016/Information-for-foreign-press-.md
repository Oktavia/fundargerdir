BACKGROUND OF THE ELECTIONS
Elections in Iceland were brought forward in the aftermath of the Panama Papers’
scandal, which led to the biggest protest in Icelandic history on April 4th 2016 where
22.000 from a nation of 330.000 took to the streets to protest a government whose
ministers were involved in the Panama Papers. In that week 81% wanted the Prime
Minister to resign and 69% wanted the Finance Minister to resign. Both ministers
along with the Minister of the interior figured in the Panama Papers along with
roughly 600 other Icelandic nationals.
Previously the conservative coalition government had bypassed parliamentary
protocols to derail Iceland‘s EU bid, despite having promised, prior to the last
parliamentary elections, to hold a referendum on whether accession talks should
resume.
The conservative coalition government also discontinued special fisheries fees and
cancelled the wealth tax.

The newly installed Minister of the Interior was also involved in offshore accounts
exposed by the Panama Papers leak, with the previous Minister of the Interior having
had to resign due to a scandal involving leaking of sensitive information on asylum
seekers from Nigeria, while the Minister of Education and Culture was also accused
of corruption in office.

OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES IN ICELAND
The Independence Party
Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn (IS) is a centre-right political party. It was formed in 1929
through a merger of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. From 1929, the
party won the largest share of the vote in every election until the 2009 election, when
it fell behind the Social Democratic Alliance. Until Benediktsson took the leadership
after the 2009 defeat, every Independence Party leader had also held the office of
Prime Minister.

The Progressive Party
Framsóknarflokkurinn (IS) is a centre-right political party. It was founded in 1916 to
represent Iceland's farmer class. Its primary support still comes from the rural areas of
Iceland and its policy roots still stem from its origin as an agrarian party, although it
has since come to self-identify as a liberal party, though this is disputed outside of the
party. It has been in government since 2013, having two Prime Ministers, as
Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, the ex leader of the party, had to step down as PM
following the Panama Papers scandal. His successor was Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson,
current leader of the party.
